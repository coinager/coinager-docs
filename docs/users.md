# Users

The app can be used with multiple users,
where each user can have his/her account and the transactions can be tracked individually.
To invite a user, [switch to Family View](intro.md#switching-views) and navigate to users' menu.

# Adding a User

The first super admin user is added when the application is set up.
To add or invite more users to the family, click on `New User` on the users' menu page.

You need to provide

1. Name
2. Email - needs to be actual email

An email is sent to that new user along with a random one time password,
which the user should ideally change after login.

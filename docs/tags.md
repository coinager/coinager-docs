# Tags

Tags are somewhat like [categories](categories.md), but any entity can be attached to multiple tags.
Tags are more flexible and can be used across any models (Incomes, Expenses and Transfers).
They can be used with custom logics to generate custom reports. Again these are optional when creating any transaction.

Tags have been associated with a color (hex-code); which can be used in reports and charts.

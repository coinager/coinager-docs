# Application Overview

**Coinager app** is not just another expense manager. This is far more than that.

## Ideology behind the app

There are a lot of expense managers out there,
but none of them offers the level of sophistication and customization that Coinager offers.
All of them lacked the features which I needed.

The core idea behind the app is
to provide a way to track your individual revenue streams and also add your family members.

## Views

The app is running with 2 different views.

1. Individual view
  The individual view is displays all data only to the logged-in user.
  Any operation done will be recorded under that user.
  The user can add incomes, expenses, transfers, recurring incomes, recurring expenses and recurring transfers.
  
2. Family view

   The family view is a read-only view with data from all family users.
   This view has filters to to filter out data for any selected user.
   This view can add or invite new users to use the application.
